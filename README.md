# Challenge Project: Find Your Hat
## Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

## Setup Instructions
If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. You’ll need to open and work in **main.js** in a text editor. To edit **main.js**, use your text editor of choice. If you need a recommendation or help to install an editor, we recommend looking into our [article about setting up a text editor for web development](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/visual-studio-code) (Follow along until you get to the section: “Practice: Let’s Make a Project”). To run **main.js** on your computer, you will need to install Node.js. If you need help installing Node.js, read our [article on installing Node](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally).
